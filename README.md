# Machine_Learning_Algorithms

Link to GitHub Pages:

A lot of machine learning focused classes do not have the time to require their students to manually implement the algorithms discussed throughout the semester. This project implements a number of the algorithms discussed in CS 7641: Machine Learning, CS 7650: Natural Language, and CS 7643: Deep Learning since the best way to truly understand these algorithms is to implement them from scratch.
